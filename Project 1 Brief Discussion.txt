Comparing my code to ChatGPTs code, I realized that both our codes are quite similar, although my code - in my opinion -  is much simpler. Though we both used while loops, ChatGPT used do-while loops compared to my basic while loops. For all the integers and functions I used ints and ChatGPT used doubles. The main difference, however, between both codes comes in terms of the display. ChatGPT's display seemed to be in a more tabular form and I used full sentences for my display.
